Welcome to the CRISM Spectral Analysis Suite
=====================================================

Welcome to the CRISM Spectral calculator.  This command line tool implements 35+ algorithms for the analysis of CRISM MRDR and potentially TRDR (TRR3) data products.  Currently, only the surface algorithms have been implemented.

CRISM Spectral Analysis Suite (CSAS) is released into the public domain without warranty.  Algorithms implementations are currently untested and should be verified against existing, published, results to confirm output.
